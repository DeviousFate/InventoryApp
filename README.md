# InventoryApp
CS 360 Final Project

I developed an Inventory App with the main goal of helping users manage their inventory efficiently. The app includes secure login and registration, the ability to add, update, and delete inventory items, and SMS alerts for low inventory. It is designed to provide users with a simple yet effective way to track and manage their inventory without losing data when the app is closed.

To ensure the app meets user needs, I focused on making data entry and management easy. Users can quickly add, search, update, and delete inventory items, and all data is stored in a local SQLite database to maintain persistence between sessions. The SMS alert feature notifies users when stock levels are low, allowing them to act before they run out of critical items. The appâ€™s interface includes a login/registration screen, a dashboard displaying inventory items in a grid view, and update dialogs for editing item details. I aimed for a clean and organized layout with clear labels and input fields to ensure smooth navigation. The UI design reduces clutter, provides immediate feedback through Toast messages and alerts, and maintains consistency across screens.

I approached coding the app using a modular design to keep the code organized and maintainable. I implemented a clear separation of concerns by creating distinct classes for handling the database (DBHelper) and user interactions (DashboardActivity). This structure made it easier to manage code and troubleshoot issues. I also focused on reusability by developing methods for loading data, handling CRUD operations, and checking for duplicates. By following an incremental development process, I was able to build and test each feature step-by-step, ensuring each component worked correctly before moving on to the next.

To validate functionality, I extensively tested the app on an Android Emulator, verifying every feature from login and registration to database operations and SMS alerts. I conducted manual tests by entering different types of data and used debugging techniques like Logcat to track and resolve issues. Testing was crucial to ensuring that the app performed as expected under different conditions and helped uncover edge cases early in development.

Throughout the development process, I faced challenges that required creative problem-solving. One of the main challenges was handling duplicate inventory items in a user-friendly way. To address this, I implemented a feature that checks for duplicate names in a case-insensitive manner and prompts the user to either update the existing item or add a new one. This solution improved the overall user experience and demonstrated my ability to solve problems efficiently.

A key part of the project that highlights my knowledge and skills is the integration of the SQLite database with a user-centered UI. The DBHelper class, combined with modular functions in DashboardActivity for managing CRUD operations, showcases my understanding of both backend data management and front-end design. This component demonstrates my ability to write clean, maintainable code while keeping the user experience a priority.

This project has provided valuable insights into the entire mobile app development process, from planning and design to coding and testing. It has strengthened my ability to develop functional and user-friendly applications and has prepared me to take on more complex projects in the future.
